# Google Analytics Fullscreen Javascript Bookmarklet
A small javascript bookmarklet that shows Google Analytics in fullscreen in your browser, without the header and side menu bars. It's a quick way to showcase analytics on a big screen.

## How to install and run the bookmarklet ##
The below instructions were tested on Google Chrome Version 59.0 but they are supposed to work on other browsers as the way to add a bookmarks is quite consistent across browser vendors.

Simply copy & paste the below Javascript code and create a new bookmark in your browser.

```javascript
javascript:var div=document.getElementById("ID-headerBar");if(div)div=div.style;if(div)void(div.display=div.display=="none"?"block":"none");var div=document.getElementById("ID-gafe4Nav");if(div)div=div.style;if(div)void(div.display=div.display=="none"?"block":"none");
```

In Google Chrome you can start by bookmarking this page:
1. Click on the star in the address bar to bookmark this page.
2. Copy & paste the Javascript bookmarklet above.
3. Click on the menu item *Bookmarks* and select *Bookmark Manager*.
4. Hover over the bookmark that you have just created and click the triangle on the right.
5. Choose *Edit...* from the menu and change the title of the bookmark.
6. Next paste the bookmarklet with `CTRL+V` (Windows) or `CMD+V` (OSX) in the field next to title.
7. Hit enter and that's it!

Now fire up Google Analytics and choose the bookmark that you have edited to run the Javascript code.
